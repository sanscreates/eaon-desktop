/// with background-dragging on, that drags the whole window instead of the
/// pill — and fighting that resolution before it wins is also why the
/// gesture felt like it was landing a beat late. A single real `NSView`
/// covering the control's own bounds, with `mouseDownCanMoveWindow`
/// overridden to `false`, makes AppKit's hit-test resolve to "not

/// a press is active, the highlight follows the cursor/finger directly and
/// continuously (a real slide, not a jump between fixed slots) — per Emil's
/// "spring-based mouse interaction" guidance, tying a visual straight to
/// live pointer position is what makes a drag feel physically connected to
/// the hand. On release it springs the rest of the way to the nearest
/// segment's exact frame; that's the one moment worth a real animation, so
/// it's a real (if restrained) spring rather than the instant tracking
/// during the drag itself. Kept deliberately subtle everywhere else — this
