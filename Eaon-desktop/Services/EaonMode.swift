/// teaching blocks go into the system prompt, and how long the agent loop is

/// across both (they're both conversational). Image generation is its own
/// independent capability (see `ChatViewModel.imageModels`) reachable by
/// picking an image model from the regular model picker in either mode — it
/// isn't gated behind a dedicated mode of its own.

/// catalog (files, apps, browser, AppleScript) separately from Agent's
/// coding-only tool subset. It's folded into Agent now: Agent is the one
/// general-purpose on-device mode, with a Sandboxed/Auto toggle that governs
/// every tool it can call, and an explicit, off-by-default opt-in in
/// Settings (`DesktopControlStore.isEnabled`, formerly Claw's own enable
/// gate) that widens its tool set from just coding to the full device
/// catalog when the user turns it on.
